# Contribution Guidelines

No external contributions are being accepted at this time, as this project is
being developed for a class.

Please note this repository enforces linear commit history and commit signing.
Please ensure your development branch is up to date before attempting to make
any changes, and rebase onto main before pushing commits. You should have a
signing key configured for your account - SSH is preferred. You can learn more
about how to do that in the [GitHub docs].
