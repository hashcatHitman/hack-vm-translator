notes = """
Safety invariants for the two `unsafe` blocks were verified locally using `kani`
`v0.67.0`. The code doesn't appear to do any concerning filesystem access,
network access, or code generation. No effort has been made on my part to verify
the actual correctness of the implementation, but given that the bulk of it
seems to be generated from a specification and the vast majority of the Rust
ecosystem depends on this crate transitively, I'm going to give it the benefit
of the doubt and say it is probably fine, especially since earlier versions have
already been audited by several registry members such as Google and Mozilla.
